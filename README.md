Core Java problem 
We are developing a program as per condition of discounts are given:
On	a	retail	website,	the	following	discounts	apply:
- If	the	user	is	an	employee	of	the	store,	he	gets	a	30%	discount
- If	the	user	is	an	affiliate	of	the	store,	he	gets	a	10%	discount
- If	the	user	has	been	a	customer	for	over	2	years,	he	gets	a	5%	discount.
- For	every	$100	on	the	bill,	there	would	be	a	$	5	discount	(e.g.	for	$	990,	you	get	$	45	
as	a	discount).
- The	percentage	based	discounts	do	not	apply	on	groceries.
- A	user	can	get	only	one	of	the	percentage	based	discounts	on	a	bill.
Initially we input name of customer and then ask type of customer then ask for bill amount and also about its is grocery or not.
If it's a grocery then this percentage discounts are not applied as per condition. 
If it's not a grocery then we ask about type of customer(employee,affiliate or customer over 2 year).create 3 function to calculate final bill as per their discounts after that also you have to give discounts $5 per $100.
display the final bill.
